Mine is fast, memory-efficient, single-header minimal cryptography implementation for small-medium projects that cannot afford to link to external libraries.

# Overview
It all started with [ripe](https://github.com/amrayn/ripe) that depends on third-party library (initially OpenSSL then Crypto++) linked statically. However after deploying [residue](https://github.com/amrayn/residue) with ripe to older distributions of linux, we learnt that portability is an issue for ripe as _minimal_ library (because of it's dependencies). So we started to implement standards forming _Mine_.

We are very careful with our implementations and have over 50 [test cases](/test/) in-place.

# Installation (API)
Simply copy `mine.h` and `mine.cc` from [`package/`](/package/) directory to your project or your local machine.

Alternatively, feel free to link it as shared or static library (you will need to compile yourself)

# Installation (CLI Tool)
You can either download binary for your platform via [releases](https://github.com/amrayn/mine/releases) page or using NPM

```
npm install -g mine-linux@latest
sudo ln -s `which mine-linux` /usr/local/bin/mine
```

```
npm install -g mine-darwin@latest
sudo ln -s `which mine-darwin` /usr/local/bin/mine
```

# Features
Mine supports following features:

 * Base16 Encoding
 * Base64 Encoding
 * RSA [[RFC-3447](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447)]
 * AES [[FIPS Pub. 197](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf)]
 * ZLib (Depends upon libz)

This is what we are aiming for _minimal_ crypto library.

# Notes

 * It is natively developed on macOS and Linux operating systems
 * It is extremely fast with compiler optimization level 1 (or higher)
 * RSA needs big number implementation, for unit tests we use [Integer from Crypto++](https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Integer)
 * RSA currently does not support signing & verification or reading keys from PEM files

# Quick Reference

### Base16

 * `mine::Base16::encode(str);`
 * `mine::Base16::encode(str.begin(), str.end());`
 * `mine::Base16::decode(encoding);`

### Base64

 * `mine::Base64::encode(str);`
 * `mine::Base64::encode(str.begin(), str.end());`
 * `mine::Base64::decode(encoding);`
 * `mine::Base64::decode(encoding.begin(), encoding.end());`
 * `mine::Base64::expectedLength(n);`

### AES

 ```c++
 std::string random256BitKey = mine::AES::generateRandomKey(256);

 mine::AES aesManager;
 aesManager.encrypt(b16Input, hexKey, mine::MineCommon::Encoding::Base16, mine::MineCommon::Encoding::Base64); // takes base16, encrypts and returns base64

 aesManager.setKey(random256BitKey); // now use this key
 aesManager.encr(b16Input, mine::MineCommon::Encoding::Base16, mine::MineCommon::Encoding::Base64); // don't need key with requests
 aesManager.decr(b64Input, mine::MineCommon::Encoding::Base64, mine::MineCommon::Encoding::Raw); // Returns raw string
 ```

### ZLib

 * `mine::ZLib::compressString(str);`
 * `mine::ZLib::decompressString(str);`
 * `mine::ZLib::decompressFile(outputFile, inputFile);`
