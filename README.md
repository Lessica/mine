Mine is fast, single-header minimal cryptography implementation for small-medium projects that cannot afford to link to external libraries.

# Overview
It all started with [ripe](https://github.com/muflihun/ripe) that depends on third-party library (initially OpenSSL then Crypto++) linked statically. However after deploying [residue](https://github.com/muflihun/residue) with ripe to older distributions of linux, we realized that portability is an issue for ripe as _minimal_ library. So we started to implement standards forming _Mine_.

We are very careful with our implementations and have [unit tests](/test/) in place.

# Installation
Simply copy `mine.h` and `mine.cc` from [`package/`](/package/) directory to your project or your local machine.

Alternatively, feel free to link it as shared or static library (you will need to compile yourself)
 
# Features
Mine supports following features:

 * Base16 Encoding
 * Base64 Encoding
 * RSA [[RFC-3447](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447)]
 * AES [[FIPS Pub. 197](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf)]
 * ZLib (Depends upon libz)
 
This is what we are aiming for _minimal_ crypto library.

# Notes

 * It is natively developed on macOS and Linux operating systems
 * It is extremely fast with compiler optimization level 1 (or higher)
 * RSA needs big number implementation, for unit tests we use [Integer from Crypto++](https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Integer)
 * RSA currently does not support signing & verification or reading keys from PEM files

# Contribution
You can contribute to the project by testing on various platforms (e.g, Windows, Android etc)
