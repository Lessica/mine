# Introduction
It all started with [ripe](https://github.com/muflihun/ripe) that is dependent upon third-party library (initially OpenSSL then Crypto++) statically linked. However after using it for a while in [residue](https://github.com/muflihun/residue), we realized that portability became an issue for _minimal_ library. So we decided to start implementing the standards ourself, forming _mine_. 

# Status
Currently, it is not production ready. It depends upon third-party library. We are actively working on the development and implementation of RFC. We cannot guarantee the timeframe as all the contributors are full time workers and only do this project in their spare time.

# Features
Mine _will_ support following features:

 * RSA (Encrypt, Decrypt, Sign and Verify) [[RFC-3447](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447)]
 * AES-CBC [[RFC-3602](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3602)]
 * ZLib (Depend upon libz, eventually implement [[RFC-1950](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3602)]
 * Base-64 (Encode, Decode)
 * Hex (Encode, Decode)
 
For _minimal_ library this is what we are aiming.
